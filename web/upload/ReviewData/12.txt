great script and performance! 
We've not come very far since this classic in terms of high quality cop crime dramas. Acting and direction is perfection.
Not only the best Neo-Noir film ever made, it's also a modern classic and one of my absolute favorite movies. Acting is particularly impressive and many of the actors do their careers best performances.
